<blockquote>In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted Fn, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,[1]
    0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144,...Fibonacci numbers are strongly related to the golden ratio: Binet's formula expresses the nth Fibonacci number in terms of n and the golden ratio, and implies that 
    the ratio of two consecutive Fibonacci numbers tends to the golden ratio as n increases.</blockquote>

        if (n == 0)
            return {0, 1};
    
        auto p = fib(n >> 1);
        int c = p.first * (2 * p.second - p.first);
        int d = p.first * p.first + p.second * p.second;
